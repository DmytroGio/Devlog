# 2025 — Developer Year Summary

2025 was a year of grounding myself as a developer and engineer.

Instead of chasing visibility or publishing unfinished work, I focused on **deep, practical development**: understanding how desktop software is designed, built, refined, and maintained over time.

## Public Work

By the end of the year, I have **two public projects** that represent my current level and direction:

- **Vision Compass** — a minimalist goal and task navigation tool built with C++ and Qt6  
  A long-running project focused on UI/UX clarity, application structure, data integrity, and iterative refinement.

- **AI Chat GUI** — a local desktop interface for interacting with LLMs  
  Focused on C++ ↔ QML integration, async communication, performance issues, and real-world configuration challenges (CUDA, llama.cpp, GPU offloading).

These projects were treated not as demos, but as **real applications**, with attention to architecture, design, stability, and long-term maintainability.

## Non-public Development

Alongside public repositories, I worked on several **small, practical tools** and experiments:
- CLI and GUI utilities  
- Task-specific solutions developed for learning and freelance exploration  
- Internal projects that prioritized problem-solving over presentation

Not all of this work is public — intentionally.  
The focus was on **engineering growth**, not exposure.

## What Changed This Year

My approach shifted from exploration to intention:
- from learning isolated concepts → to building systems  
- from starting many ideas → to finishing and polishing  
- from code-for-code → to usability, structure, and reliability

I began thinking more like an engineer:
how software behaves over time, how users interact with it, and how small decisions compound.

## Key Lessons

- A few well-developed projects say more than many abandoned ones  
- Real problems teach faster than artificial exercises  
- Finishing and refining builds confidence  
- Software quality is the result of iteration, not inspiration

## Looking Forward

The next step is simple and clear:
continue building desktop tools, expand the public portfolio thoughtfully, and deepen engineering discipline.

No rush. No shortcuts.  
Just steady, deliberate progress.
