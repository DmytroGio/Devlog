**Context**
– Organizing project structure and GitHub
– Working on C++ freelance projects

**Completed**
– Decided to move devlog to a separate repository
– Defined the structure of `_Devlog`

**Understood**
– Chaos in files → chaos in my head
– Devlog is a layer above projects, not inside them

**Next step**
– Create a `devlog` repository
– Write README.md (briefly)

**Template**
- Written and tested template for "Batch File Processing." 
Add Batch File Processor - desktop utility for text file operations

Implemented Qt6-based Windows application for batch processing of text files (.txt, .csv) with the following features:

Core functionality:
- Remove empty lines and trim whitespace
- Sort lines alphabetically
- Merge multiple files into one
- Rename files using pattern templates ({index}, {original})
- Generate detailed processing report

Technical details:
- Clean architecture: separated UI (MainWindow), processing logic (FileProcessor), reporting (Report), and utilities (Utils)
- UTF-8 encoding support
- Graceful error handling - continues processing on individual file failures
- Non-recursive folder scanning

Use cases:
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Bulk file renaming
- Text normalization for further processing

### Devlog: SimpleDataParser_CSV

### Update: Core Logic Integration & Output Management

**Key Changes:**
* **Processing Workflow:** Implemented the `processFile` method, integrating `Parser`, `Logger`, and `CsvWriter` into a single execution flow.
* **Dynamic Output Directory:** Added a directory selection feature using `QFileDialog`, allowing users to define where `output.csv` and `errors.log` are saved.
* **Data Export:**
    * Validated rows are now automatically exported to a structured CSV file.
    * Malformed entries are captured by the `Logger` and saved to an error log with line-specific details.
* **Bug Fixes:** Resolved linker errors (LNK2019) by providing the missing implementation for the main processing logic.

**Tech Stack:** C++17, Qt 6 (Widgets), CMake.
