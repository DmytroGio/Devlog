**Context**
– Organizing project structure and GitHub
– Working on C++ freelance projects

**Completed**
– Decided to move devlog to a separate repository
– Defined the structure of `_Devlog`

**Understood**
– Chaos in files → chaos in my head
– Devlog is a layer above projects, not inside them

**Next step**
– Create a `devlog` repository
– Write README.md (briefly)
